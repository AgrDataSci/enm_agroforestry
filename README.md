Coffee and cocoa agroforestry in a warmer Mesoamerica
=====================================================

Overview
--------

Climate change threatens coffee production and the livelihoods of thousands of families in Mesoamerica that depend on it. Replacing coffee with cocoa and integrating trees in combined agroforestry systems to ameliorate abiotic stress are among the proposed alternatives to overcome this challenge. These two alternatives do not consider the vulnerability of cocoa and tree species commonly used in agroforestry plantations to future climate conditions. We assessed the suitability of these alternatives by identifying the potential changes in the distribution of coffee, cocoa and the 100 most common agroforestry trees found in Mesoamerica.

Notes about input data
----------------------

### WorldClim

This analysis uses bioclimatic variables from [WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org/version1) as input data. These files are too large to upload to GitHub. In order to replicate this analysis you must download the files via [WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org/version1) and add it to the directory data/worldclim.

### Ensemble models

Ensemble model outputs are also too large to upload to GitHub (approx. 90 GB). If you want to get access to these files please open a request on the [issues](https://github.com/agrobioinfoservices/enm_agroforestry/issues) section or via e-mail to the repository maintainer.
